# CSS-flexbox Project

view project [here](http://melmar12.github.io/LlamaDrama) 

Made with vanilla HTML and CSS. I focused on responsive design and used `flex-box` properties to create responsive grids.

This was a project for an internship apllication with the guidelines "Make a website about llamas."
Enjoy the llamas!
