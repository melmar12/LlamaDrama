# CSS-flexbox Project

view project [here](http://melmar12.github.io/LlamaDrama) 

I got creative and had a little fun with this project as part of the application process for a Frontend Web Developer Intern position. The guidelines for the project were pretty simple, "Make a website about llamas", so I decided to keep it that way and 
create a static website and show what I could do with vanilla HTML and CSS. I focused on responsive design and used `flex-box` properties to create responsive grids. I got to showcase my photoshop skills with the llama banner. I thought the end result came out fun, functional and simple. With this project, I got the opportunity to fly out for an onsite interview :relaxed:
