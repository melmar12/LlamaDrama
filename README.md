# Zappos Summer 2016 Internship Application Project

So I got to get creative and have a little fun with this project as part of the application process for the Frontend Web Developer Intern position at Zappos. The guidelines for the project were simple, so I decided to keep it that way and create a simple static website and show them what I could do with just HTML and plain CSS. I focused on responsive design and thought the end result came out fun, functional and simple. The recruiters seemed to think so too, because I got the amazing opportunity to fly out to Vegas and interview with Zappos :relaxed:
