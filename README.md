I got to get creative and have a little fun with this project as part of the application process for the Frontend Web Developer Intern position at Zappos. The guidelines for the project were pretty simple, "Make a website about llamas", so I decided to keep it that way and 
create a static website and show them what I could do with vanilla HTML and CSS. 

> "make a website about llamas"

I focused on responsive design and used `flex-box` properties to create responsive grids. I also got to showcase my photoshop skills with the llama banner. I thought the end result came out fun, functional and simple. With this project, I got the opportunity to fly out to Vegas and interview with Zappos :relaxed:
